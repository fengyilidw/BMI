              <h5>NALDA ABELLARD (2016-2017)</h5>
              <p>Nalda joined the BMI during her first semester in college in 2015 and ever since then she has been a member of the BMI. Although she is extremely brilliant, she faced many challenges due to her courses, but the BMI was able to help her get through it. In addition, she was able to pass Chemistry both Fall and Spring semester because of the tutoring that was offer in the BMI program. This semester she got an A in chemistry which is a big accomplishment especially since she didn’t think that it was possible, but the support that she received at the BMI office made her think that it is possible. She will be graduating in the Spring Semester of 2017 with an Associate Degree in Liberal Arts and Science while obtaining a 3.7GPA, but her journey doesn’t stop there. Nalda will be transferring from City Tech to Brooklyn College to continue her studies while majoring in Biology. Moreover, Nalda’s long term goal is to become a dermatologist or a Physician Assistant in dermatology.</p>

              <p>After serving in The United States Marine Corps as a Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) and after the completion of two tours of duty during OEF (Operation Enduring Freedom). Javier came back to City Tech to finish his degree as an Applied Mathematics major. Coming back to school after being out for a considerably long time was an obstacle for him and he had to catch-up in most of the science and math courses. This meant a lot of self-study and discipline to refresh what Javier had previously learned. During his time in school, he worked as a Math tutor at the Veterans office at City Tech. As a member of City Tech’s BMI program, Javier also worked as part of the Peer Lead Team Learning (PLTL) in Chemistry and Mathematics. He presented and completed research programs in Mexico, Texas, Washington D.C., and New Mexico, in the United States as well in a 2016 summer internship program in Brookhaven National Laboratories. Javier received a National Science Foundation Scholarship during his last three semesters in City Tech and graduated as part of the National Society of Collegiate Scholars with a Magna Cum Laude degree designation. His future plans are to continue giving back to the community and to continue on to graduate school for Computational Mathematics.</p>

              <h5>Marlon Myers (2017-2018)</h5>
              <p>Marlon Myers is a 23-year-old Afro-Caribbean young man who studied Computer Engineering Technology, at New York City College of Technology. In the beginning of his childhood, he grew up in the slums and ghettos of Kingston Jamaica for the first 13 years of his life. Even though he grew up in an environment surrounded by poverty, through hard work and perseverance, he was able to maintain high scholastic achievements. At the starting line of Marlon’s College experience, due to poor academic advisement, Marlon’s G.P.A went down. After his first year, he was placed on academic probation, not knowing where he fits in. Until one day he was called by the Assistant to the director, of the City Tech Black Male Initiative Program, Ms. Sonia Johnson, and from that day in the semester of Fall 2013, Marlon decided that he did not want to become a statistic; another young black man, to fall through the cracks of the educational system. Through his years of being in the Black Male Initiative program, Marlon has risen to becoming one of the most notable figures on the Campus of City Tech. He began to excel in his academics, gaining the achievement of being on the Honor Roll. He was the President of the Black Male Initiative (BMI) club; a subgroup of the BMI program at City Tech for an approximation of 1 and a half years. In addition, he served on the Student Government Association for 3 years. The first 2 years as a Senator At Large, and his third year as the Vice President of the Student Government body of 17,000+ students. He also became a proud member of the National Society of Black Engineers, National Society of Leadership and Success, and 500 Men Making a Difference. Beyond the idea of simply being a member of 500 Men Making a Difference, he serves as their Director of Collegiate Engagement. He is also the youngest ever recipient of their “Man of the Year Award.” Throughout his academic studies at City Tech, Marlon single handedly designed, built, and programmed, from scratch, a Quadcopter Drone using an Arduino Uno. His dedication to the improvement of his community, exemplifies true leadership.Marlon Graduated with an Associates in Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology, a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering Technology. He is also in near completion of both a degree in “Liberal Arts and Science”, and a Liberal Arts and Arts.”</p>

              <p>Marlon uses the stories of his experience to Encourage and Mentor his fellow peers and/or anyone in need of advice. He does this so that they too can learn that no matter how many times you fall, always get back up, brush yourself off and try harder. Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.” – Confucius</p>

              <p>In this life, you walk the path of trial and tribulations. It is a journey that prepares you for the hardships to come; it breaks you, but molds you; it destroys you, yet grows you; it builds character and helps shape you to be what you were meant to be. It is these words that shaped Joel Chapman, now a graduate of Bachelors of Science in Applied Mathematics, to what he is now. Growing up was not always easy as Joel did not have all the resources, especially financially, to help him through life. A lot of battles and hurdles came every now and then, but the only thing that Joel knew how to do was press on. It is an ability that he forged after coming to a breaking point in one of his toughest battles. To be precise, it was one of those moments when he fought one of his biggest battles, it drove him to a wall mentally, and in the end, and he could do nothing but just sit and laugh at it all. Did you know that even though storms create destruction along your path, it can also clear your path? Joel sure did not know this until his fateful encounter with Dr. Janet Liou-Mark, a professor in Mathematics, and a major turning point in Joel’s life.</p>

              <p>Through Professor Liou-Mark, Joel was able to begin doing things he never imagined that he could do now. He initially joined one of the Professor’s program known as Peer-Lead Team Learning – in short, a team put together to help facilitate students in different mathematic courses. Not too long afterwards, Joel was introduced to Dr. Reginald Blake, the head of City Tech’s Black Male Initiative (BMI) Program. He requested that Joel join the program, and he did the very same day. Through BMI and Peer Leading, Joel was able to work on his communication and presentation skills by volunteering to speak at various on-campus and off-campus presentations and workshops. Also, due to the fact that he became a math tutor in more than 3 courses, he was able to build my teaching skills and also get familiarized with speaking to people as he was (and still a bit) heavily introverted.</p>

              <p>The BMI Program has basically worked wonders for Joel. Once again, through Dr. Blake and Professor Liou-Mark, Joel was able to become a National Science Foundation Intern and worked at New York City’s Department of Environmental Protection. He is still currently working there and is now pursuing an offered full-time position there. Joel is basically grateful for all the efforts that BMI, Peer Leading, God, and everyone along the way put into him. Without them, he would not be where he is today, but life has a way of working out for the fortunate.</p>

              <h5>Tevin Harris (2019-2020)</h5>
              <p>Tevin Harris was born in Kingston, Jamaica. He migrated to the United States of America in 2013 to live with his mother and step-father in Bronx, New York. His journey at New York City College of Technology began in Spring 2015, He was new to the USA school system as City Tech would became the first university that he would attend. He struggled to pass his classes the first two semesters and as a result he was placed on academic probation. Being in trouble, Tevin sought help and that help came in the form of the Black Male Initiative (BMI) Program where he got one on one tutoring in Math. Tevin’s grades started to elevate and his time at City Tech became more fruitful. He believed in the act of giving back to his fellow students, so he signed up to become a Math Tutor and Peer Mentor in the BMI Program. He would study long hours to grasp the information and broaden his horizon that he went on to teach Algebra and Trigonometry to 8th-12th graders within the Bridging the Gap Program at City Tech. He had the opportunity to conduct research through the Emerging Scholars (ES) Program under the mentorship of Professor Guida, “Virtue at the Coffee House: Poetry, Community and Culture in America” focused on conducting interviews with poets and others involved in the organization and sustenance of poetry communities.</p>

              <p>Tevin was also accepted into the CUNY Service Corps program that resulted in an internship at the 125th Street Business Improvement District as a Program Assistant Coordinator for the Director of Programs and Operations. Tevin continue to spread his wings and became a part of other programs on campus such as, National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS) as the current Social/Society Events Chair, as well as an alumnus of ASAP. Tevin graduated June 2018 with an associate in Computer Information Systems. He is close to completing his bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems (Database Management). Through all that has been accomplished throughout my time at City Tech, it would have never been possible without the motivation from Ms. Sonia Johnson, Dr. Reginal Blake, Ms. Gwendolyn Odle and others from the BMI Program. Tevin is currently on staff at City Tech in the office of Student Life & Development, where he aims to discover new ways on how to make students college experience more substantial</p>
